_[Portfolio](http://www.jonathanlouisng.com)_

My portfolio was created with React; the animated balloons were copied wholesale (with minimal tweaks) from a [pen](https://codepen.io/bennettfeely/details/nbFCp) by [Bennett Feely](https://codepen.io/bennettfeely/), while the icons were by [Devicon](http://konpa.github.io/devicon/) and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io).
