  'Happy Birthday, Cara Bunny',
  'You taste sweeter than pure honey',
  'You make me happy so I’ll share',
  '33 lines to show I care',

  'You make me feel both brave and bold',
  'You steal my heat when you are cold',
  'You have the most amazing smile',
  'For you I’d go the extra mile',

  'You’re cute when wearing spectacles',
  'You’re the envy of all the girls',
  'You look stunning in any dress',
  'Even better when you wear less',

  'I like to stare into your eyes',
  'So intelligent and so wise',
  'I long to kiss your luscious lips',
  'And watch you shake those sexy hips',

  'You love to live, you love to eat',
  'You cannot count the salsa beat',
  'But I would dance with you all night',
  'Won’t let you stray but hold you tight',

  'I step on you (by accident)',
  'Because your pout is heaven-sent',
  'You somehow always smell divine',
  'So amazing I’m glad you’re mine',

  'I love to touch you cheek to cheek',
  'Your cushy bum is what I seek',
  'I like how you squirm at my hand',
  'I’ll make you happy on demand 😏',

  'You’re beautiful in every way',
  'Your laugh is like the sunniest day',
  'You share your joy with everyone',
  'Time spent with you is endless fun',

  'Have a great year, you’re perfect dear!'
